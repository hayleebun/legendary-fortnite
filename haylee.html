    <h2 class="hayleeh2">Thank you for coming to my page! </h2>
      <p class="haylee"> Here's some things about me that you should know :)</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I studied illustrations for a couple years and like art</li>
          <li>I've been into cooking recently! I made a really good Korean barbecue pork sandwich</li>
          <li>I like rhythm games</li>
          <li>To relax, I sometimes go to a karaoke room by myself</li>

  <section id="main">
    <h2 class="hayleeh2">Karaoke</h2>
      <p> I feel like the biggest misconception about karaoke is that you have to be a good singer to enjoy it. The secret is that you don't have to be good, you just have to be a good performer and it's fun. That said, there are certain songs that are a must when I go and certain songs I think should be banned from karaoke rooms and karaoke stages alike. </p>

    <h2 class="hayleeh2">Music, Games, and Concerts</h2>
      <p class="haylee"> I've always loved music! When I was younger, I was convinced that I would study music therapy at university (before I learned how much schooling it requires and how little they make).<br> Nowadays, I just use music as a way to relax and  have fun. My favorite kind of games are music and rhythm games. I also go to concerts with friends. It's a good reason to dress up in clothes I wouldn't wear anywhere else, so I usually enjoy myself and take lots of pictures. <br> I also really like making mood specific playlists! They're definitely based on my personal taste, but I'll share a couple. These are playlists with songs based on certain Pantone shades!
